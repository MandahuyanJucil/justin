                    <p class="expalain">Baking is all about precision, so a complete set of measuring cups and spoons is a must. You'll need dry and wet measuring cups to accurately measure all your ingredients. <br> Keep these tools in a spot that's easy to get to because you'll use them all the time.  <br>
                    
                        Most measuring spoon sets include a tablespoon, teaspoon, ½ teaspoon, and ¼ teaspoon, while most measuring cups come in sets with one cup, ½ cup, ⅓ cup, and ¼ cup. <br> You can get by with a 1-cup size for liquid measuring cups, but it can be handy to have 2-cup and 4-cup ones in your cupboard, too.</p>

                    <p class="expalain"> 
                    One wooden spoon is enough, but this baking tool is very handy, so it can be helpful to have a couple around. Wooden spoons are so sturdy they're great for all kinds of stirring. <br> You can use them with even the thickest, heaviest dough. Just remember to handwash them when you're done so they don't end up cracked.

                    <p class="expalain"> 
                        We bet you reach for your rubber spatula more often than you think. <br> This baking tool is ideal for scraping the last bit of batter or dough out of a pan or the nooks and crannies of your jam jar. <br> They're also super handy for folding together wet and dry ingredients. Note that silicone scrapers will withstand high heat better than rubber ones.

                <p class="expalain"> 
                    When transferring fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies to a cooling rack or serving a cake from a 9x13 pan, there's no better baking tool than a spatula.<br>Having one with a thin metal blade can be especially handy, and it'll be flexible enough to easily slide under anything you're moving without squishing the dough or crumbling your cookies.

                        This handy baking tool has more uses than you may realize. It can be used to grease a pan before pouring in cake batter, <br> to coat the dough with melted butter or egg wash, or to "paint" milk on top of a pie crust. Especially if you're a frequent baker, this is a must-have!

                        Yes, you can use a wire whisk to beat together a few eggs, but it's handy for other things, too. In particular, it's one of the best ways to thoroughly mix wet and dry ingredients. <br> It's also great for stirring together a homemade custard.

                        Rolling pins are most useful for rolling out pie crusts, cookie dough, and puff pastry, but there are other ways you can put this baking tool to work in your kitchen. <br> For example, if you don't have a food processor and need to crush cookies, chips, or crackers for a recipe, just put them in a sealable bag, then use your rolling pin to smash them to pieces.

                        You can put a sieve to work in a lot of different ways. For bakers, it's probably the most useful for sifting dry ingredients or adding a dusting of powdered sugar to a finished pan of brownies or cookies. <br> This baking tool also comes in handy for draining wet ingredients (especially small items, like quinoa, that would slip through a regular colander) and removing seeds from raspberry sauces.

                        While you don't need to go all-out on a fancy stand mixer, you need at least a hand mixer in your arsenal of baking essentials. <br> It will make mixing dough and batters faster and easier, and it's the best way to mix ingredients into a thick, stiff cookie dough without tiring out your arm.

                        You should have two of these baking essentials on hand, since you'll need more than one to make a layer cake. <br> Round cake pans come in 8-inch and 9-inch diameters, but either size will work with most layer cake recipes-just be sure you have two pans in the same size.
